The Boids library is derived from the James Hetherington's implementation 'bad-boids' located <a href="https://github.com/jamespjh/bad-boids" target="_blank">here</a> as part of the Research Software Engineering with Python course under module code MPHYG001 at University College London. James implemented the base functionality and for that reason please add James Hetherington's GitHub URL to your citation: https://github.com/jamespjh/bad-boids. James teaches the MPHYG001 course at UCL and thus any citation should also reference this.
