Boids <br>
=============================================

This library allows a user to simulate flocking birds with the ability to change the parameters of the programme to analyse different behaviour. The models used were proposed by Craig W. Reynolds in his paper entitled *"Flocks, Herds, and Schools:
A Distributed Behavioral Model"*. A copy of this paper can be found <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87" target="_blank">here</a>.
